Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the core—a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.

### Cross-platform editing
Atom works across operating systems. You can use it on OS X, Windows, or Linux.

### Built-in package manager
Search for and install new packages or start creating your own—all from within Atom.

### Smart autocompletion
Atom helps you write code faster with a smart, flexible autocomplete.

### File system browser
Easily browse and open a single file, a whole project, or multiple projects in one window.

### Multiple panes
Split your Atom interface into multiple panes to compare and edit code across files.

### Find and replace
Find, preview, and replace text as you type in a file or across all your projects.
