    <description><![CDATA[Redis is the open source, in-memory data store used by millions of developers as a database, cache, streaming engine, and message broker.

### Core capabilities

- In-memory data structures: Well-known as a "data structure server", with support for strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams, and more.
- Programmability: Server-side scripting with Lua and server-side stored procedures with Redis Functions.
- Extensibility: A module API for building custom extensions to Redis in C, C++, and Rust.
- Persistence: Keeps the dataset in memory for fast access, but can also persist all writes to permanent storage to survive reboots and system failures.
- Clustering: Horizontal scalability with hash-based sharding, scaling to millions of nodes with automatic re-partitioning when growing the cluster.
- High availability: Replication with automatic failover for both standalone and clustered deployments.

### Disclaimer

You should use it for local development and follow Redis official guidance to deploy it on Linux for production environment. This project doesn't bear any responsibility for any losses caused by using it and is only for learning and exchange purposes.

- Bitmap - `BITOP`: new operators: `DIFF`, `DIFF1`, `ANDOR`, and `ONE`
- Query Engine - new SVS-VAMANA vector index type which supports vector compression
- More than 15 performance and resource utilization improvements
- New metrics: per-slot usage metrics, key size distributions for basic data types, and more

### Binary distributions

- Alpine and Debian Docker images - https://hub.docker.com/_/redis
- Install using snap - see https://github.com/redis/redis-snap
- Install using brew - see https://github.com/redis/homebrew-redis

  - `OVERWRITTEN` - the value of a key is completely overwritten
  - `TYPE_CHANGED` - key type change

### Bug fixes (compared to 8.2-RC1)

- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14162 Crash when using evport with I/O threads
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14163 `EVAL` crash when error table is empty
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14144 Vector sets - RDB format is not compatible with big endian machines
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14165 Endless client blocking for blocking commands
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14164 Prevent `CLIENT UNBLOCK` from unblocking `CLIENT PAUSE`
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14216 TTL was not removed by the `SET` command
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14224 `HINCRBYFLOAT` removes field expiration on replica

### Performance and resource utilization improvements (compared to 8.2-RC1)

- [#Q6430](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/6430) More compression variants for the SVS-VAMANA vector index
- [#Q6535](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/6535) `SHARD_K_RATIO` parameter - favor network latency over accuracy for KNN vector query in a Redis cluster (unstable feature) (MOD-10359)
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14144 Vector set - improve RDB loading / RESTORE speed by storing the worst link info 

### Modules API

- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14051 `RedisModule_Get*`, `RedisModule_Set*` - allow modules to access Redis configurations
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14114 `RM_UnsubscribeFromKeyspaceEvents` - unregister a module from specific keyspace notifications
