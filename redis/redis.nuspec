    <description><![CDATA[Redis is the open source, in-memory data store used by millions of developers as a database, cache, streaming engine, and message broker.

### Core capabilities

- In-memory data structures: Well-known as a "data structure server", with support for strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams, and more.
- Programmability: Server-side scripting with Lua and server-side stored procedures with Redis Functions.
- Extensibility: A module API for building custom extensions to Redis in C, C++, and Rust.
- Persistence: Keeps the dataset in memory for fast access, but can also persist all writes to permanent storage to survive reboots and system failures.
- Clustering: Horizontal scalability with hash-based sharding, scaling to millions of nodes with automatic re-partitioning when growing the cluster.
- High availability: Replication with automatic failover for both standalone and clustered deployments.

### Disclaimer

You should use it for local development and follow Redis official guidance to deploy it on Linux for production environment. This project doesn't bear any responsibility for any losses caused by using it and is only for learning and exchange purposes.

    <releaseNotes><![CDATA[[Releases](https://github.com/redis-windows/redis-windows/releases)

This is the General Availability release of Redis 8.6 in Redis Open Source.

### Major changes compared to 8.4

- Substantial performance improvements
- Substantial memory reduction for hashes (hashtable-encoded) and sorted sets (skiplist-encoded)
- Streams: `XADD` idempotency (at-most-once guarantee) with new `IDMPAUTO` and `IDMP` arguments
- New eviction policies - least recently modified: `volatile-lrm` and `allkeys-lrm`
- Hot keys detection and reporting; new command: `HOTKEYS`
- TLS certificate-based automatic client authentication
- Time series: support NaN values; new aggregators: `COUNTNAN` and `COUNTALL`

### Binary distributions

- Alpine and Debian Docker images - https://hub.docker.com/_/redis
- Install using snap - see https://github.com/redis/redis-snap
- Install using brew - see https://github.com/redis/homebrew-redis
- Install using RPM - see https://github.com/redis/redis-rpm
- Install using Debian APT - see https://github.com/redis/redis-debian

### Operating systems we test Redis 8.6 on

- Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish), 24.04 (Noble Numbat)
- Rocky Linux 8.10, 9.5
- AlmaLinux 8.10, 9.5, 10.1
- Debian 12 (Bookworm), Debian 13 (Trixie)
- macOS 14 (Sonoma), 15 (Sequoia)

### New Features (compared to 8.6-RC1)

- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14695 Keys memory size histograms

### Performance and resource utilization improvements (compared to 8.6-RC1)

- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14714 Optimize user ACL permission verification
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14692 Optimize peak memory metric collection
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14739 Avoid allocating and releasing list node in reply copy avoidance
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14713 Reduce per command syscalls by reusing cached time when hardware monotonic clock is available
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14726 Optimize `XREADGROUP CLAIM`
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/13962 Vector set: replace manual popcount with __builtin_popcountll for binary vector distance (Intel, AMD, ARM)
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14474 Vector set: vectorized the quantized 8-bit vector distance calculation (Intel, AMD)
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14492 Vector set: vectorize binary quantization path for vectorsets distance calculation (Intel, AMD)

### Configuration parameters

- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14719 `cluster-slot-stats-enabled` - per-slot resource consumptions statistics to collect
- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14695 `key-memory-histograms` collect memory consumption histograms per data type

### Metrics

- https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14695 `db0_distrib_lists_sizes`, `db0_distrib_sets_sizes`, `db0_distrib_hashes_sizes`, `db0_distrib_zsets_sizes`

### known bugs and limitations

- Streams: avoid using `XADD` with the new `IDMP` or `IDMPAUTO` options when using `appendonly yes` with `aof-use-rdb-preamble no` (non default).
  This limitation will be removed in the next patch.
