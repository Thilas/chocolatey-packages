    <releaseNotes><![CDATA[[Releases](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/releases)

This preview release is based on [.NET 10.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0). Please make sure that you have it installed on your machine beforehand.

# New Language Features
* Update pattern detection to Roslyn 5.0 RTM
* C# 13: `allows ref struct` constraint
* C# 14: `extension` members

# Enhancements
* `CSharpConversions`: General improvements, fixing various missing rules for C# up to version 9.
* #3344: Support `ckfinite` IL opcode in decompiler
* #3563: Disassembler: Add support for ildasm /caverbal format
* Detection of records and primary constructors: various bugfixes and improvements. (Special thanks to @sonyps5201314 and @mmusu3)

# User Interface

* Do not use ObservableObject when ObservableObjectBase is sufficient. (see #3644 by @tom-englert)

# API Clean-up
* Removed legacy `UnresolvedUsingScope`
* Renamed `ResolvedUsingScope`  to `UsingScope`
* Removed legacy `ToTypeReference`
* Removed `ITypeReference` and implementations

# Bug fixes
* Fix #3524: Property without backing field cannot have an initializer.
* Fix #3512: Local function name collides with local variable name
* Fix #2165: DeclareVariables step must update ResolveResult annotation when using out var.
* Fix #3518 by replacing `FixLoneIsInst` with an inlining restriction.
* Fix #3465: Operator '>' cannot be applied to operands of type 'X' and 'X'
* Fix #3468: Try harder to avoid ref locals if `UseRefLocalsForAccurateOrderOfEvaluation` is not enabled.
* Fix #3323: Simplify cleanup in AwaitInFinallyTransform, ensuring that we do not miss any containers.
* Fix #1873: Clear ILRange in CopyPropagation

* Fix #3543: Missing parentheses around field assignment expression in list initializers
* DebugDirectoryTreeNode: AddressOfRawData and PointerToRawData columns should use hex display.
* DebugDirectoryTreeNode: PointerToRawData was always showing 0 and AddressOfRawData was showing the wrong value.
* Fix #3577: Properly infer the switch governing type and preserve conversions
* Fix #3626: Do not emit named arguments for bool constants, if it causes the call to become ambiguous.
* Fix #3612: WholeProjectDecompiler.CleanUpName does not count bytes on Unix.
