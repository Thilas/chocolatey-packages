    <summary>ILSpy is the open-source .NET assembly browser and decompiler.</summary>
    <releaseNotes><![CDATA[[Releases](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/releases)

ILSpy 9.x is based on .NET 8.0. All artifacts **except** the self-contained distribution are built framework-dependent, which means [.NET 8.0.x or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) must be installed prior to starting ILSpy. Note that ILSpy 9.1 also allows a later runtime via #3391.

# New Language Features
* Update pattern-detection to Roslyn 4.13

# Enhancements
* #1572: Do not generate variable names that match C# keywords.
* #2716: Add an option to allow sorting custom attributes
* #3377: Extend error information if multiple assemblies with the same (short) name are selected when creating a solution file.
* #3393: Option to turn off smooth scrolling
* #3399: Add module filename as ToolTip of AnalyzerEntityTreeNode
* #3440: Added support for evaluation-order-preserving reference type check
* #3316: Add "variable scopes" to improve naming local variables and anonymous method parameters

# Contributions
* Add support for array initialization based on `RuntimeHelpers.CreateSpan<T>` (see #3380 by @ds5678)
* Load resource stream outside of delegate (see #3389 by @snorrk)
* Allow ILSpy to launch, when net8.0 is not installed, but a later version (see #3391 by @nil4)
* Fix nested namespace directories (see #3449 by @ds5678)
* Fix #3402: System.NullReferenceException on right click on .NET 9 (see #3403 by @tom-englert)
* Add an option to turn off smooth scrolling (see #3405 by @tom-englert)
* Use type hint in pointer arithmetic (see #3413 by @ds5678)
* Improve UI for primary constructors on non-record types (see #3455 by @ds5678)
* Fix exception when writing resx files without adding any resources (see #3418 by @jwfx)
* Enhance null handling in switch transformations (see #3422 by @ds5678)
* Don't include generic constraints in generated explicit overrides (see #3443 by @ds5678)
* Improve generation of not equals check (see #3425 by @ElektroKill)

# Bug fixes
* Fix #2269: LocalFunctionDecompiler misplaces nested local functions in ctors
* Fix #3322: Add missing checks for equality comparison
* Fix #3378: Navigation shortcuts (Alt-Left and Alt-Right) don't work when TreeView has focus
* Fix #3381: Make sure that selectedNode is still selected when focus is deferred in IsActive property changed handler.
* Fix #3383: more aggressively transform object initializers on structs
* Fix #3384: add special case for null-literal conversions in optional argument handling.
* Fix #3385: Allow address uses of structs in using transform, if the reference is passed to an in parameter.
* Fix #3392: uses of init-setters must use object-initializer syntax.
* Fix #3401: Multiple problems when exporting an assembly as project
* Fix #3414: Apply latest session settings before saving upon closing the main window
* Fix #3342: Wrong null check in MethodVirtualUsedByAnalyzer
* Fix #3450: Fix "Clear assembly list" not actually persistent.
* Fix #3432: Do not include delegate construction use-sites in  DetermineCaptureAndDeclarationScopes.
* Fix attributes tooltip of GenericParam metadata table
