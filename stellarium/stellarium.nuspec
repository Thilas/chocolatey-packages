Glad to announce the release of Stellarium 25.1 for all platforms. This is our first release in 2025 with exciting features and many bug fixes.

The major changes of this version:
- Switching to using Gaia DR3 catalog (extra catalogues with more than 220 milliones stars)
- Full 6D astrometry (2D sky positions, 2D proper motion, parallax, radial velocity) compute for most bright stars (V<10.5)
- Modelling movement for 15 couples of binary stars
- New powerful data format for sky cultures
- Many improvements in Core
- Improvements in Telescope Control plugin
- Updates in sky cultures (include new one)
